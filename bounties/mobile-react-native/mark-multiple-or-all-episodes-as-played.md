# Mark multiple and/or all episodes as played

[Github issue](https://github.com/podverse/podverse-rn/issues/935)

This feature will potentially involve changes to each of the following repos:

podverse-api
podverse-rn
podverse-web

If you'd like to work on it, there's no pressure to complete the work in all 3 repos. podverse-api will need changes in either case, but you could choose between podverse-rn (mobile app) or podverse-web (web app).
