# Mark multiple and/or all episodes as played

[Github issue](https://github.com/podverse/podverse-rn/issues/935)


There are 3 separate repos associated with this task and the work can be done by different people independently:

podverse-api $100 (assigned to @bramskis)\
podverse-rn (assigned to @kreonjr)\
podverse-web $100

If you'd like to work on it, there's no pressure to complete the work in all 3 repos. podverse-api will need changes in either case, but you could choose between podverse-rn (mobile app) or podverse-web (web app).
