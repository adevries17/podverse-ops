We could really use help with writing and maintaining our FAQ. I struggle to put things into words. There's a lot of stuff I can explain but it's really tough for me to write into final drafts. Our core devs are also so busy with programming that prioritizing user-facing documentation / FAQs is difficult.

If you'd be interested in helping write Podverse FAQs or documentation, please let us know. I'm not entirely sure the bounty pay or structure would be, as there may be times when we need a lot of documentation help, and times when we do not, but we're open to discussing / negotiating it.
